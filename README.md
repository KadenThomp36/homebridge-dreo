# Homebridge Dreo Plugin

This is a Homebridge plugin that allows you to control Dreo smart devices.

## Compatability
I've tested this plugin with my DR-HTF001S Tower Fan. It should work with other smart fans but I don't have any more to test. Please let me know if you have another model that works or doesn't work. The plugin *should* also be compatible with multiple devices on the same account but I haven't tested this. Non-fan smart devices are not supported at this time, but if you have another device and can help me test some code out I would definitely be open to adding support.
